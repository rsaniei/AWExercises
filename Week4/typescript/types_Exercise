Question1:TypeScript allows developers to add types to JavaScript.

Question2:JavaScript is a loosely typed language.

Question3:The TypeScript compiler can be configured with which file?
tsconfig.json

Question4:There are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:
1:Implicit
2:Explicit

Question5:Create a "firstName" variable, string type using Implicit type:

let -----   = "Dylan";

Question6:Create a "firstName" variable, string type using Explicit type:

let ----:---- = "Dylan";

 Question7:Create an empty "myVar" variable, and disable type checking:


 Question8:Create an empty "myVar" variable, and specify it should be an unknown type:

 Question9:What will be the output of the followinf lines of code?think and discuss first before writing this code


Question10:What will be the output?

function greet(person, date) {
 console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date}!`);
}
greet("Brendan");

Question 11:let obj: any = { x: 0 };
Uncomment the code below and see if the complier throws an error or not
//obj.foo();
//obj();
//obj.bar = 100;
//obj = "hello";
//const n: number = obj;


QUestion12:Add a strict null check for this piece of code
Declare const loggedInUsername: string;

const users = [
  { name: "Oby", age: 12 },
  { name: "Heera", age: 32 },
];

const loggedInUser = users.find((u) => u.name === loggedInUsername);
console.log(loggedInUser.age);

// Note:When strictNullChecks is false, null and undefined are effectively ignored by the language. This can lead to unexpected errors at runtime.

// When strictNullChecks is true, null and undefined have their own distinct types and you’ll get a type error if you try to use them where a concrete value is expected.
